Text Based Adventure Game
=========================

Students start with knowledge from the "Python as a Calculator" project:

* Understanding of basic Python syntax
* Calculations (operators)
* Basic types (str, int)
* Basic understanding of variables (e.g. "Hello %n" % name)
* Basic program flow (if/else & loop)
* Simple IO (numbers only)
* Basic data manipulation (score counter)

By the end of this project students will:

* Have an understanding of iteration.
* Be able to use and manipulate lists.
* More complex program flow.
* Data modelling.

Differentiation points:

* Maps as directed graphs
* User defined functions.

Lesson 1
========

* Recap knowledge from "Python Calculator"
 * Exercises
 * Quiz
* Recap of program flow (if/else)
* Given sample program, code review and discussion.
* 20minute task to improve sample program.

Lesson 2
========

* Recap lesson 1 (if/else/elif)
* Repeating tasks (like moving backwards, killing monsters) used to introduce for loops.
 * Simple exercises to practice for loops
* Improve sample program from lesson 1 to include for loops.

Lessons 3 & 4
=============

* Discussion, "What else might an adventure game have"?
* RPGs, characters, locations, the story, items, goals and achievements etc...
* Using the example of items, introduce lists as a means of storing inventory of rooms.
* Practice basic lists (like a present list) add to list, remove from list, take from list.
