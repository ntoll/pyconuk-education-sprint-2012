Education Sprint - PyconUK 2012
===============================

What do you think students should learn?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* How to think like a computer scientist:
 * The teacher isn't always right, and doesn't always know the answer.
 * Problem solving.
 * CS Unplugged.
 * Cultural shift from Teachers PoV.
* Teamwork:programming is not just a solo activity.
* Programming is a creative process that can be fun.
* Patience.
* It's not magic (although it can seem magical).
* Computers only do what you tell them to (providing the computer is running a sane environment).
* Documentation is essential: explain your code, show your working
* The manual is your friend. Know where to look, and *do it yourself*.
* Programming really isn't that hard!
* Programming is for solving problems. Find an itch and scratch it.
* How to access, query and understand data (opportunity for cross-curriculum collaboration).

What do you think teachers need to know in order to teach programming?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* A programmming language, at least to the level of skill expected of the students.
* A place to look up reference material and resources (to know where to get second level support).
* Understand the free-culture/creative commons outlook (to **be** [not have] part of a community).
* Where to ask for help:
 * IRC
 * teacheroverflow.com
 * stackexchange.com
 * computingplusplus.org
 * STEM
 * Etc...

Project Ideas for Schools
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Pygame Games
* Pyweek
* Raspberry Jam
* Turbine recording data into a RPi.
* Beep Beep
* Text based adventure games ftw!
